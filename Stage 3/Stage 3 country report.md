### **1.0 Reported Cases of Cholera in Nigeria**

Cholera outbreaks have experienced extreme fluctuations, with peaks reaching about 60,000 reported cases between 1990-2000, whereas no case was reported between 1949-1970. There was a spike in the reported cases around the early 1970s, with more than 20,000 cases reported, indicating a severe outbreak during that period. Following the early peak, cases seem to stabilize or drastically reduce, with most years in the 1980s and early 1990s showing relatively low case counts, some under 10,000.
